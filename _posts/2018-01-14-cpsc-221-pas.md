I a skilled and enthusiastic software developer, but most of my experience has come from course work and previous co-op terms. I realized my portolio was looking a little light on the software end, so thought I would share my solutions for the programming assignments from the Algorithms & Data Structures course I took this fall. I achieved a final grade of 98% in this course and I have since been hired on as undergraduate teaching assistant.
