    <p class="lead">I'm Dylan Green, a fourth year student in UBC's Engineering Physics program.
    I am primarily interested in software development, hardware electronics and physics,
    but enjoy anything that involves out-of-the-box thinking and hands on problem solving. 
    <br>  <br>
    I am currently looking for a 4-8 month work term, starting in May 2019. Happy browsing!</br></p>
