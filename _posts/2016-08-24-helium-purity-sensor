In the summer of 2016 I was hired under a contract from the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute (QMI) to assist in the design and production of an ultrasonic gas purity monitor. This project was initially commissioned by UBC’s Advanced Materials and Processed Engineering Laboratory (AMPEL) as an ENPH 479 capstone design project, in order to mitigate costs associated with occasional interruptions to the operation of the building’s liquid helium recovery system caused by impurities in gaseous helium.

My primary responsibility was the mechanical design and fabrication of an initial test prototype. The device is housed in 1.5’’ ABS pipe which is to be fitted onto existing helium recovery lines in the AMPEL building. Two ultrasonic transducers are mounted inside at a known distance apart from one another, and are used to take time of flight measurements of the speed of sound within the pipe. Using the variance in the speed of sound through different mediums, this data can then be used to calculate the relative purity of helium travelling through the device.

Solidworks was used to design the transducer mounting system seen below. Specific design considerations were made for the accurate alignment of the transducers, cost and machinability of materials, ease of assembly and the use of fast prototyping technologies. Additionally, multiple holes were made in the connecting rods as shown, allowing for different transducer separation distances to be tested without producing additional prototypes. Various versions of the parts shown below, with slight alterations, were then fabricated and assembled using water jet cutters, 3d printers, and basic machine tools.
