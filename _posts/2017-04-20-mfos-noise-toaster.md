Part of my decision to get an engineering degree was in the hopes I'd eventually be able to design and build my own analog synthesizers. In order to get one step closer to this goal I decided to build a Music From Outer Space (MFOS) Noise Toaster, a simple single board, single oscillator analog synth. The late Ray Wilson, owner of MFOS and a major contributor to the DIY synth community, wrote Make: Analog Synthesizers, a companion book to this project which explains the design process of each component and how it works, as well as general principles of synth design.
