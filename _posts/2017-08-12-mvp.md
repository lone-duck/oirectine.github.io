## The Competition

Every summer UBC's Engineering Physics program hosts a robotics competition to give students experience in the practical aspects of instrument design and fabrication. This year's competition, entitled Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies, had teams design and build fully autonomous robots to rescue six trapped secret agents by avoiding an alarmed door, scaling a narrow ramp, and rescuing the agents from a tank filled with water, sending the agents back to safety on a zipline. I worked with a team of three other students to develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP), shown below completing these tasks in the fastest recorded time of 37 seconds.
