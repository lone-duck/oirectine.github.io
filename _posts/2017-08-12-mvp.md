## The Competition

Every summer UBC's Engineering Physics program hosts a robotics competition to give students experience in the practical aspects of instrument design and fabrication. This year's competition, entitled Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies, had teams design and build fully autonomous robots to rescue six trapped secret agents from an evil fortress.  I worked with a team of three other students to develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP), shown below completing this task in 37 seconds, the fastest recorded time for a full recovery of all six agents.
