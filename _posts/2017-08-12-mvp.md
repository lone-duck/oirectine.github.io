## The Competition

Every summer UBC's Engineering Physics program hosts a robotics competition to give students experience in the practical aspects of instrument design and fabrication. This year's competition, entitled Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies, had teams design and build fully autonomous robots to rescue six trapped secret agents from an evil fortress.  I worked with a team of three other students to develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP), shown below completing this task in 37 seconds, the fastest recorded time for a full recovery of all six agents.

## Electrical Design

I acted as electrical lead for this project and was responsible for the design, construction, troubleshooting and integration of all electronics. Emphasis was placed on modularity and simplicity to aid in troubleshooting. 

#### TINAH Board
MVP is controlled by a TINAH, an open source microcontroller designed specifically for use in the competition. TINAH reads input from switches, parameter knobs, IR and reflectance sensors and sends commands to the DC and servo motors. Our code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/eyqs/enph253/blob/master/robot_final/robot_final.ino).

##### IR Detection

An alarmed gate near the start of the course emits a 1kHz signal when the gate is armed and a 10kHz signal otherwise. MVP was equipped with an IR detection and filtration circuit to allow for safe passage through the gate. This circuit includes a DC block, non-inverting amplifier, bandpass filter and peak detector, resulting in a DC output signal proportional to the intensity of the received signal.

In the final build, the signal was split and passed through 1 kHz and 10kHz configurations of the above circuit in parallel, the outputs of which were fed into a comparator, providing a digital signal indicating whether the beacon signal is currently at 1 or 10kHz.
