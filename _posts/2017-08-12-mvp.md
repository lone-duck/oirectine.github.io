## The Competition

Every summer UBC's Engineering Physics program hosts a robotics competition to give students experience in the practical aspects of instrument design and fabrication. This year's competition, entitled Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies, had teams design and build fully autonomous robots to rescue six trapped secret agents from an evil fortress.  I worked with a team of three other students to develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP), shown below completing this task in 37 seconds, the fastest recorded time for a full recovery of all six agents.

## Electrical Design

I acted as electrical lead for this project and was responsible for the design, construction, troubleshooting and integration of all electronics. Emphasis was placed on modularity and simplicity to aid in troubleshooting. 

#### TINAH Board
MVP is controlled by a TINAH, an open source microcontroller designed specifically for use in the competition. TINAH reads input from switches, parameter knobs, IR and reflectance sensors and sends commands to the DC and servo motors. Our code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/eyqs/enph253/blob/master/robot_final/robot_final.ino).

#### IR Detection

An alarmed gate near the start of the course emits a 1kHz signal when the gate is armed and a 10kHz signal otherwise. MVP was equipped with an IR detection and filtration circuit to allow for safe passage through the gate. This circuit includes a DC block, non-inverting amplifier, bandpass filter and peak detector, resulting in a DC output signal proportional to the intensity of the received signal.

In the final build, the signal was split and passed through 1 kHz and 10kHz configurations of the above circuit in parallel, the outputs of which were fed into a comparator, providing a digital signal indicating whether the beacon signal is currently at 1 or 10kHz.

#### Motor Control

The TINAH motor outputs are incapable of driving the high torque motors we used at full current. We implemented H-Bridge circuits based on the following design using discrete components to allow for bidirectional, high power motor control using the PWM outputs of the TINAH.

Knowing that H-Bridges failing had been a trouble point for teams in previous years, we wanted our H-Bridges to be accessible and easily replaceable. We also wanted the H-Bridges to be installed outside of the main electronics bay to reduce interference with sensor signals, requiring the overall design to be small enough to fit alongside the drivetrain.

### Signal Routing

Signals from rotary encoders, reflectance sensors, and the IR detection circuit were passed through a central routing board to decrease clutter and aid in troubleshooting/integration. Reflectance sensor signals (used for tape following) are passed through a comparator with common threshold controlled by the on-board potentiometer to output a digital signal indicating whether a given sensor is currently on or off the tape.

MVP was powered by one 16V and two 8V lithium polymer batteries. Regulated 15V an 5V signals as well as separate grounds for motor and sensor systems were similarly routed through a single board.
