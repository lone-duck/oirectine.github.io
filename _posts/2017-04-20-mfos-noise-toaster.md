Part of my decision to get an engineering degree was in the hopes I'd eventually be able to design and build my own analog synthesizers. In order to move a step closer to this goal I decided to build a [Music From Outer Space (MFOS) Noise Toaster](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/NOISETOASTER/NOISETOASTER.php#SCHEMPG1), a simple single board, single oscillator analog synth. The late Ray Wilson, owner of MFOS and a major contributor to the DIY synth community, wrote Make: Analog Synthesizers, a companion book to this project which explains the design process of each component and how it works, as well as general principles of synth design. 

Building, testing, and debugging this project, alongside reading the book, has given me great insights into synthesizer and electronics design in general, and has really helped me improve my soldering skills. I am currently in the process of designing an enclosure, and have started working on an 8 step sequencer (also from MFOS). I am planning to build my own synthesizer with integrated sequencer from the ground up this summer, including the design and PCB layout.
