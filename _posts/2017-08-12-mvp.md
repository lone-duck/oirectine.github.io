## The Competition

Every summer UBC's Engineering Physics program hosts a robotics competition to give students experience in the practical aspects of instrument design and fabrication. This year's competition, entitled Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies, had teams design and build fully autonomous robots to rescue six trapped secret agents from an evil fortress.  I worked with a team of three other students to develop Minimum Viable Product (MVP), shown below completing this task in 37 seconds, the fastest recorded time for a full recovery of all six agents.

## Electrical Design

I acted as electrical lead for this project and was responsible for the design, construction, troubleshooting and integration of all electronics. Emphasis was placed on modularity and simplicity to aid in troubleshooting. 

##### IR Detection

An alarmed gate near the start of the course emits a 10kHz signal when the gate is armed and a 1kHz signal otherwise. MVP was equipped with an IR detection and filtration circuit (pictured below) to allow for safe passage through the gate.
