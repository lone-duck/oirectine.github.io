I am a competent and confident software developer, but most of my experience has been from course work and previous work terms. I realized my portolio was looking a little light on the software end, so thought I would share my solutions for the programming assignments in the Algorithms & Data Structures course I took this fall (which I got a mark of 98% in ;^)).

Assignment files and specs can be found [here](https://github.com/oirectine/cpsc221).
